# hubspot-jinja

This intend to create a local environment where you can use Hubspot templates to render locally within jinja.

## Status
Currently this is a POC (proof of concept). Do not use in live environment nor use as your main workflow as this is in a pre-alpha status.

## How to use
It's still a work in progress and currently there is not a workable version.
